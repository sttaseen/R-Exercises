**Methods and Assumption**

We have a numerical measurement made ontwo distinc groups, so we should do a two-sample
t-test.

We assume the customers are independent of one anothe r. THe equality of variance and Normality assumptions looks to be satisfied. We can use the standard two-sample t-test.

The model fitted is agesij = mu + ai + eij where ai is the effect of whether the person buys Crest toothpaste or not, either purchaser or nonpurchaser, and eij~iidN(0, sd^2).


**Executive Summary**

These data were collected to asses whether there was a difference, between purchasers of Crest toothpaste compared to purchasers of other brands, with respect to the age of the person responsible for household toothpaste purchases.

We have observed that the age of the person in the household primarily responsible for toothpaste purchases is, on average younger for Crest purchasers than for non-purchasers.

We estimate that the mean age for purchasers of Crest toothpaste is up to 15.1 years younger than the mean age for non-purchasers of Crest toothpaste.
