**Methods And Analysis**

We are trying to estimate the mean of one group of data, so we use one sample t-test.

The inter arrival times for the jobs should be independent of each other. The dots being on a straight line on the Q-Q plot suggests that the data follow normality.

We model the data as IAR<sub>i</sub> = μ + epsiloni where μ is the mean in the inter arrival times and epsiloni ~iid N(0, sd^2).

**Executive Summary**

We are interested in estimating the inter arrival times for jobs in the Cecil Storage Area Network by using data from "Server 26" at a peak time. The data contains 38 jobs.

We estimate the mean inter arrival time to be between 129 and 144 microseconds.
