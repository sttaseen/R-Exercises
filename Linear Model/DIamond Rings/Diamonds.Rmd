**Methods and Assumptions**

The price seems to be linearly changing with the weight of the diamonds, so we use a linear model.

The normality assumptions seems to be satisfied with all the data points being on a line on the Q-Q plot. The variance assumption also seems to be satisfied as seen from the residual plot. The price and weight of the diamond rings being independent to one another is assumed.

There were no observable outliers in our Cook's plot so no data points are removed.

The data is modelled using pricei = B0 + B1 * weighti + ei where ei ~iid N(0, sd^2).


**Executive Summary**

We are interested in finding a model between diamond ring prices and their diamond weights in Singaporean retialers based on data collected by lecturer few year ago.

There is a strong positive association between the weight of the diamond and the price of the ring - the heavier the diamond, the higher the price of the ring.

A 0 carat diamond ring seems to be priced on average between -294 and -225 Singaporean Dollars with each carat increase increases the mean price by between 3556 and 3386 Singaporean Dollars.

Our model explains 98% of the variance so it is a really good model for predictions.

We estimate the price for a 0.3 carat diamond ring to be between 790 SGD and 923 SGD.

Our data only has diamond rings weighing up to 0.35 carats so we cannot rely on the predictions for the 1.2 carat-ring.
