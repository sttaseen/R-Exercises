I couldn't get my hands on the data file. So, I will be using this notebook to answer the questions.

a) Comment briefly on the exploratory analysis of this dataset.

Ans: The median price per gram near Mexico is $653 which is lower than that for near California which is $1875. The prices for northern California seems to be more spread apart than the ones in Near Mexico due to outliers. Both groups look to be right-skewed,

b) What can we conclude from the output of
eovcheck(PricePerGram âˆ¼ reg, data = heroin.df)?

Ans: The variances of the two regions doesn't look to be the same. The Californian prices are more spread apart.


c) What can we conclude from the p-value of the t-test?

Ans: We have strong evidence against the null hypothesis which is that the median prices for drugs is the same for both regions. This suggests that our method might be working.


d) Write down the effects model equation of the model.

Ans: log(pricesij) = mean +ai + eij where ai is the effect of being in the group and eij ~ iid N(0, sd^2).

e) Write a brief Executive Summary detailing the findings from this analysis.

Ans: We are interested in comparing the Brown Heroin prices between two regions: Northern California and near Mexican border in the US based on data collected by undercover federal agents.

We had to transform our data in order to perform our analysis. As a result, our estimates are based on the difference in median prices of drugs in these two regions and is in multiplicative terms.

We found that the median prices for this drug is more in Northern California than near the Mexican border.

We estimate the median price for this drug near the Mexican border is between 14% and 64% lower than the price in Northern California.
